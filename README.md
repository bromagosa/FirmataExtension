# Firmata Extension for Snap!
This is meant to be a drop-in replacement for Snap4Arduino. Some functionalities will probably never be achievable, such as streaming the stage via HTTP or exposing an API to control Snap<em>!</em> from the outside, however the aim is to implement all the Arduino-related functionalities that Snap4Arduino provides.

In the mid-term we plan to allow converting Snap4Arduino projects automatically.
